# FYS4150-Project-1
Repository for project 1, subject FYS4150 at Univeristy of Oslo

For this project I used Visual Studio 2019 (VS) as IDE, and C++ as programming language.
All the programs were compiled using the built-in compiler of VS, none have been compiled through terminal. 

All the .sln-files are project files that can be opened in VS. The .cpp-files are stored in the folder with the same name.

I also used the linear algebra library Armadillo for C++ to LU-decompose and solve the problem.
All files produced by the program are stored as a .txt-file. 

Project 1b).cpp is the general algorithm for solving the problem, using Gaussion elimination, as instructed in task b) of the project description.

Project 1 - specific.cpp is the program to solve problem using a more specialized algorithm, as well a calculating the relative error to the analytical solution, as instructed in task c) and d) of project 1.

Project 1 e).cpp is the program to solve the problem using LU-decompostion, by using the library Armadillo. 

Se the Excel-file "Project 1- benchmarks" to see the different results I got for different values of n.
